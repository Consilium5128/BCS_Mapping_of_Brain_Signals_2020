## Data Analysis

This is the next and final step of our project as the team is performing artifact removal as of now.  


Under Data Analysis, the EEG data under scrutiny will be observed for variations in the areas of interest, derived from literature reviews, and a targeted approach will be used to draw ultimate conclusions. As the findings from [Artifact Removal](https://github.com/Debu922/BCS_Mapping_of_Brain_Signals_2020/tree/master/artifact_removal) are implemented into the EEG data, the process of data analysis will begin with discussions with the Faculty Mentor and **targeted literature** review will be undertaken again with observations and results being recorded and conclusions drawn out, which will comprise of **observing variations in continuous EEG data** over certain sections, namely **Bilateral Anterior Insula** and **Anterior Cingulate Cortex** of the brain in certain **frequency ranges/bands**, after performing EEG processing operations as laid out in the [EEGLAB tutorial](https://github.com/Debu922/BCS_Mapping_of_Brain_Signals_2020/tree/master/eeglab_tutorials) but customised to our data, sketching out the relevant plots and timeframes and ultimately the hypothesis being proven.
