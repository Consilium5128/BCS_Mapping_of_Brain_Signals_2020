## Literature Review

An extensive literature review was undertaken related to Mapping of Brain Signals and EEG data through Empathy for Pain with a few papers hosting slight variations from the topic but promising an excellent insight into the topic. The literature review spanned over a course of 3 weeks with weekly meetings where the students reading and analyzing the particular paper would present their findings to the rest of the group to have a discussion and improve the level of understanding.

#### The papers discussed in the first week:
* [Frequency-dependent changes in sensorimotor and pain affective systems induced by empathy for pain](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317255692_Frequency-dependent_changes_in_sensorimotor_and_pain_affective_systems_induced_by_empathy_for_pain)
* [Impaired Empathy Processing in Individuals with Internet Addiction Disorder: An Event-Related Potential Study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320297873_Impaired_Empathy_Processing_in_Individuals_with_Internet_Addiction_Disorder_An_Event-Related_Potential_Study)
* [Adaptations for social cognition in the primate brain](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/290455080_Adaptations_for_social_cognition_in_the_primate_brain)

The team worked in sub-teams of three to present the papers mentioned above.

Next week, the team took up indiviual papers approved by the Faculty mentor, Prof. K.M. Sharika.

#### The papers read and analyzed in the next week:
* ["Feeling" the Pain of Those Who Are Different From Us: Modulation of EEG in the Mu/Alpha Range](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21098810/)

* [EEG/ERP investigation of development of empathy in early and middle childhood](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878929314000632)
* [Analysis of EEG signals and its categorisation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877705812022114)
* [Neural Substrate of the Late Positive Potential in Emotional Processing](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/jneuro/32/42/14563.full.pdf)
* [Reduction of Empathy for Pain by Placebo Analgesia Suggests Functional Equivalence of Empathy](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/jneuro/35/23/8938.full.pdf)

There is a [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zqA7_O772D06AgPgVY6tMgUacFx27Q-wrb0ONXIboVo/edit?usp=sharing) which has a total of 26 papers added by the team members and the Faculty Mentor out which these papers were chosen to read and discuss because they were the closest to the study we were attempting to perform.

Apart from the papers, there were a few **books** which could enbale further depth of insights into the topic:
1. Analysing neural time series data: theory & practice by Mike Cohen
2. Electric Fields of the Brain by Paul Nunez & Ramesh Srinivasan
3. An introduction to the event related potential technique by Steven Luck
