## EEGLAB Tutorials

Electroencephalograph (EEG) is a test used to collect the data of brain activity, in the form electrical impulses, in a non-invasive manner. To analyse the EEG data MATLAB has facilitated a toolbox EEGLAB that that not only has basic processing tools but also facilitates Independent Component Analysis (ICA), time-frequency analysis, etc. 
Seeing all the benefits, we went ahead with EEG and completing the [EEGLAB tutorials](https://sccn.ucsd.edu/wiki/EEGLAB_Wiki#EEGLAB_Tutorial) was the first task of the project.

The pdf file above gives all the plots that were made and submitted by each person of the team corresponding to a sample EEG data on which we learned how to process and analyze the EEG data.

The plots correspond to the following chapters of single subject data processing:
- Chapter 01: Loading Data in EEGLAB
- Chapter 02: Channel Locations
- Chapter 03: Plotting Channel Spectra and Maps
- Chapter 04: Preprocessing Tools
- Chapter 05: Extracting Data Epochs
- Chapter 06: Data Averaging
- Chapter 07: Selecting Data Epochs and Comparing
- Chapter 08: Plotting ERP images
