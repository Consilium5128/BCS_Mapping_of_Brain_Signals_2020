## EEGLAB Tutorials

Electroencephalograph (EEG) is a test used to collect the data of brain activity, in the form electrical impulses, in a non-invasive manner. To analyse the EEG data MATLAB has facilitated a toolbox EEGLAB that that not only has basic processing tools but also facilitates Independent Component Analysis (ICA), time-frequency analysis, etc. 
Seeing all the benefits, we went ahead with EEG and completing the [EEGLAB tutorials](https://sccn.ucsd.edu/wiki/EEGLAB_Wiki#EEGLAB_Tutorial) was the first task of the project.
